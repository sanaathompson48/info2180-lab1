       <p>I am a 20 year old second year Computer Science major. I love to sing, dance and hang out with my friends. I have a sister named Vontese and I love her. My favourite colour is pink and I occasionally read books like Archie. I am interested in Web Development because I want to further my web developing skills, mostly in css, so that I can make a professional website for my business in the near future.</p>
